# A Not-So-Public Public Board
A Not-So-Public Public Board is a web application developed as a course requirement for AL101 - Algorithms and Complexity. The application combines the concept of a freedom public board with a twist of encryption, allowing users to post messages publicly while encrypting them using the Vigenère cipher algorithm. The application utilizes ReactJS for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and Flask-RESTful for the API.
